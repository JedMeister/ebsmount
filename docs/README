EBSmount: Automatically mount EC2/Eucalyptus EBS devices
========================================================

EBSmount has 2 commands:

    ebsmount-udev       Triggered by udev on EBS attach and detach
    ebsmount-manual     Manually mount EBS device (simulates udev add trigger)

Features:

    - Supports Amazon EC2 and Eucalyptus EBS devices
    - Automatically mounts EBS devices when they are attached (via udev)
    - Supports formatted devices, as well as partitions
    - Ignores unformatted devices and unsupported filesystems
    - Device/partition uniquely identifiable mountpoints
    - Configurable mount options
    - Hooking scripts execution upon mount
    - Convenience command for a one step format and mount
    - Logging

Quick start:
    
    - If the EBS device is not formatted, it will not be mounted
      automatically. For convenience, the user can format and mount the
      device in one step, for example:

        ebsmount-manual --format=ext3 /dev/sdh

Default configuration (/etc/ebsmount.conf):

    ENABLED=True
    MOUNTDIR=/media/ebs
    MOUNTOPTIONS=noatime
    FILESYSTEMS=ext2 ext3
    LOGFILE=/var/log/ebsmount.log

    DEVPATHS=/devices/xen/vbd- /devices/virtio-pci/virtio

Unique mountpoints:

    - Every EBS filesystem is mounted to its own uniquely identifiable
      mountpoint, based on:

        $(MOUNTDIR)/$(FS_UUID)[:6]

    - For example:
    
        /media/ebs/a1b2c3

Hooking scripts:

    - Once a filesystem is mounted, EBSmount will execute scripts in
      alpha-numeric ordering located in MOUNTPOINT/.ebsmount

    - This provides a very powerful mechanism. In its simplest form, the
      user might want to symlink the mountpoint to a more accessible
      path, for example:

        MOUNTPOINT/.ebsmount/10symlink

        #!/bin/bash -e
        target=/vol
        mountp=$(dirname $(dirname $0))
        [ ! -h $target ] && ln -s $mountp $target
