===================
v0.93 Release Notes
===================

* Disabled execution of hooks by default (security).

    - To enable, set RUNHOOKS=True in /etc/ebsmount.conf
    - Additionally, hook scripts won't be executed if they are not owned
      by root (uid and gid).

* MOUNTPOINT is set in environment for hook scripts usage (convenience).

* Added ext4 to FILESYSTEMS so it's supported out of the box.

* Removed EBSMOUNT_CONF envvar support (left over from testing).
